Main Ingredients: 1kg pork shoulder/neck/belly

Supporting Ingredients: Two bottles Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce, one papaya, 150g maltose, 100g Hua Diao wine, spring onions and ginger slices to taste, light and dark soy sauce to taste.

1. Cut pork into strips approximately 8cm long. Prick the meat with bamboo skewers to facilitate marinating.

2. Scoop out papaya flesh and mash it. Spread evenly over pork and marinate for 2 hours.

3. Wipe off the papaya paste from the pork surface. Coat the pork with all remaining seasonings and refrigerate overnight.

4. Remove excess sauce from the pork surface. Place on a baking tray without foil lining. Position a foil-lined tray beneath the main tray to catch dripping fat.

5. Preheat the oven to 210°C and roast for 15 minutes.

6. Heat a pan, add maltose and 150g water, stirring until dissolved. Remove from heat once small bubbles form.

7. Remove pork, brush maltose syrup over both sides. Turn pork over and roast at 200°C for 10 minutes.

8. Remove the pork, brush both sides with the maltose glaze. Turn the pork over and roast at the oven's maximum temperature for 8 to 10 minutes. Monitor the char siu closely; once the surface is caramelised, remove from the heat and plate.
